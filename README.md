# Election Manager

This app is intended to be used on an offline computer by an election admin.

### Features

- manage election configuration
- create hand-marked paper ballots
- export an "election ballot package" for [Mail Ballot Manager](https://github.com/votingworks/mail-ballot-manager)

## Workflow

1. Admin may create a new election or select an existing election configuration file (`election.json`) to start with (or possibly a previously created election ballot package).
2. Admin can edit the election configuration via simple UI forms at any time.
3. Admin can list all ballots by precinct/style.
4. Admin can view an individual ballot, both HTML and PDF versions.
5. Admin can export an election ballot package for [Mail Ballot Manager](https://github.com/votingworks/mail-ballot-manager).

   Election Ballot Package contains:

   - `election.json` - VotingWorks data format for election data: contests, canidates,ballot styles, precincts, etc.
   - approved official ballots in pdf format:
     - one for each combination of ballot style and precinct
     - file name pattern: `election-${electionId}-precinct-${dashify(precinctName)}-id-${precinctId}-style-${ballotStyleId}.pdf`
